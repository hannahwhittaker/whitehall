# Whitehall

Whitehall is a Ruby on Rails content management application for content published by government departments and agencies.

## Nomenclature

- *Govspeak* A variation of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) used throughout whitehall as the general publishing format

## Technical documentation

whitehall is a Ruby on Rails app built on a MySQL database. It is deployed in two modes: 'admin' for publishers to create and manage content and 'frontend' for rendering some content under https://www.gov.uk/government and https://www.gov.uk/world. whitehall also sends most content to the publishing-api and rummager.

Assets are currently handled by whitehall. It handles uploads, virus scanning and serving of assets. There is a current project to migrate whitehall to use [Asset Manager](http://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager).

## Dependencies

- [alphagov/asset-manager](http://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager): provides uploading for static files (migration in progress)
- [alphagov/publishing-api](http://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api): documents are sent here, persisted and then requested
- [alphagov/rummager](http://github.com/alphagov/rummager): allows documents to be indexed for searching in both finders and site search
- [alphagov/link-checker-api](https://github.com/alphagov/link-checker-api): checks all the links in an edition on request from the edition show page.

## Running the application

```
$ ./startup.sh
```
If you are using the [GDS development virtual machine](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#4-boot-your-vm) then the application will be available on the host at http://whitehall-admin.dev.gov.uk/

Further setup instructions are available in the [detailed setup guide](docs/detailed_setup_guide.md).
